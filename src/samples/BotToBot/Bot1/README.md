# Bot1 Sample

This is a sample of a simple Agent hosted on an Asp.net core web service, That represents the entry point of a multiBot configuration.  This Agent is configured to accept a request and echo the text of the request back to the caller or relay them to Bot2.

This Agent Sample is intended to introduce you the basic operation of the Microsoft 365 Agents SDK's messaging loop and how it can communicate with another Microsoft 365 Agent SDK bot.

## Prerequisites

**To run the sample on a development workstation (local development), the following tools and SDK's are required:**

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) version 8.0
- Visual Studio 2022+ with the .net workload installed.
- [Bot Framework Emulator](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator/releases) for Testing Web Chat.

**To run the sample connected to Azure Bot Service, the following additional tools are required:**

- Access to an Azure Subscription with access to preform the following tasks:
    - Create and configure Entra ID Application Identities
    - Create and configure an [Azure Bot Service](https://aka.ms/AgentsSDK-CreateBot) for your bot
    - Create and configure an [Azure App Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/) to deploy your bot on to.
    - A tunneling tool to allow for local development and debugging should you wish to do local development whilst connected to a external client such as Microsoft Teams.

## Getting Started with Bot1 Sample

### Local development

Local development means running the Sample on 'your' workstation for development and debugging purposes.

Local development begins with utilizing the Bot Framework Emulator and Visual Studio on your workstation to build and run your Agent while debugging from Visual Studio.

If you do not wish to configure authentication at this time, Skip to "Running the Agent for the first time".

### Authentication and Local Development

There are two ways to support local development, depending on what your working with.

**- Anonymous or No-Authentication**

While this is the simplest way to get started and run your Agent, there are important limitations to consider.

When running in Anonymous mode, your Agent will not be able to create authentication tokens to access other services, Nor can it interact with Azure Bot Services. Therefor, Anonymous Mode is there to support testing basic operational features of the Agent and to work with and test various events that your Agent can process. It should be used only during initial development.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This sample is configured, by default, for Anonymous Authentication. Before using this sample with Azure Bot Service, it is necessary to configure authentication.

**- Configured Authentication with Entra ID.**

Configuring authentication for your Agent will allow it to communicate with Azure Bot Services and create access tokens for other services. 

However there are a few key items to consider when configuring authentication for your Agent.

1. Both Azure Bot Service's Bot registration and your Agent Must use the same ClientID for creating an authentication token.
    1. By default Azure Bot Service will create a Managed Identity when you initially configure the bot registration.  **This type of identity cannot currently be used when working with Local Development**.
    1. To successfully use **Local Development** with an Azure bot Service Identity, you must utilize either **Client Secret** or **Client Certificate** based authentication.
1. Once you are ready to deploy to Azure App Services, you can use all types of Identity supported.
    1. Its often more efficient to have an Azure Bot Service Registration for Local Development and a separate one configured for your App Services Deployment.

#### Configuring authentication in the Bot1 Sample Project

To configure authentication into the Bot1 Sample Project you will need the following information:

1. Client ID of the Application identity you wish to use.
1. Client Secret of the Application identity you wish to use or the Certificate that has been registered for the Client ID in Entra AD

1. Once you have that information, to configure authentication, Open the `appsettings.json` file in the root of the sample project.

1. Find the section labeled `Connections`, it should appear similar to this:

     ```json
     "TokenValidation": {
       "Audiences": [
         "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" // this is the Client ID used for the Azure Bot
       ],
       "TenantId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
     },

     "Connections": {
       "BotServiceConnection": {
         "Assembly": "Microsoft.Agents.Authentication.Msal",
         "Type":  "MsalAuth",
         "Settings": {
           "AuthType": "ClientSecret", // this is the AuthType for the connection, valid values can be found in Microsoft.Agents.Authentication.Msal.Model.AuthTypes.  The default is ClientSecret.
           "AuthorityEndpoint": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/{{TenantId}}",
           "ClientId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000", // this is the Client ID used for the connection.
           "ClientSecret": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000", // this is the Client Secret used for the connection.
           "Scopes": [
             "https://api.botframework.com/.default"
          ],
          "TenantId": "{{TenantId}}" // This is the Tenant ID used for the Connection. 
       }
     }
     ```
    
1. Set the **ClientId** to the AppId of the bot identity.
1. Set the **ClientSecret** to the Secret that was created for your identity.
1. Set the **TokenValidation:TenantId** to the Tenant Id where your application is registered.
1. Set the **TokenValidation:Audiences** to the AppId of the bot identity.

1. Find the section labeled `ChannelHost`, it should appear similar to this:

   ```json
   "ChannelHost": {
     "HostAppId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000", // This is the Client ID used for the remote bot to call you back with.,
     "Channels": [
       {
         "Id": "EchoBot",
         "ChannelFactory": "HttpBotChannelFactory", // The name of the keyed IChannelFactory registered in DI
         "Settings": {
           "ClientId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000", // This is the Client ID of the other agent.
           "TokenProvider": "BotServiceConnection", // Name of the connection to use to get the token from the connections array.
           "Endpoint": "http://localhost:39783/api/messages",
           "ServiceUrl": "http://localhost:3978/api/botresponse", // ServiceUrl for response (non-streamed responses)
           "ResourceUrl": null, // This is the Resource URL when creating the token, defaults to "api://{clientId}}
           "NamedClient": null // optional named HttpClient
         }
       }
     ]
   }
 
1. Set the **HostAppId** to the AppId of the Bot1.
1. Set the **ClientId** to the AppId of the of Bot2

> Storing sensitive values in appsettings is not recommend.  Follow [AspNet Configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/?view=aspnetcore-9.0) for best practices.
    
## Running the Agent for the first time

To run the Bot1 Sample for the first time:

1. Open the Bot1 Sample in Visual Studio 2022
1. Run it in Debug Mode (F5)
1. A blank web page will open, note down the URL which should be similar too `https://localhost:65349/`
1. Open the [BotFramework Emulator](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator/releases)
    1. Click **Open Bot**
    1. In the bot URL field input the URL you noted down from the web page and add /api/messages to it. It should appear similar to `https://localhost:65349/api/messages`
    1. Click **Connect**

If all is working correctly, the Bot Emulator should show you a Web Chat experience with the words **"Say “agent” and I’ll patch you through"**
