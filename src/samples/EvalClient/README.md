        1. Click `Add Permissions`
    1. (Optional) Click `Grant Admin consent for copilotsdk`
    1. Close Azure Portal

### Create an Azure OpenAI Resource

1. Open https://portal.azure.com

1. Provide the resource details:
   1. Subscription: Select your subscription

1. Navigate to the newly created Azure OpenAI resource and under "Keys and Endpoint" note down the following values:
   1. KEY 1
   1. Endpoint
1. Explore the Aure OpenAI endpoint in Azure AI Foundry and from the Model Catalog, deploy a "gpt-40" or "gpt-35-turbo" model.
   1. Note down the deployment name.

> [!TIP]
> If you do not see `Power Platform API` in the list of API's your organization uses, you need to add the Power Platform API to your tenant. To do that, goto [Power Platform API Authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/programmability-authentication-v2#step-2-configure-api-permissions) and follow the instructions on Step 2 to add the Power Platform Admin API to your Tenant

## Instructions - Configure the Example Application

With the above information, you can now run the client `CopilostStudioClientSample`.

1. Open the appSettings.json file for the CopilotStudioClientSample, or rename launchSettings.TEMPLATE.json to launchSettings.json.
1. Configured the values for the various key's based on what was recorded during the setup phase.

```json
"DirectToEngineSettings": {
  "EnvironmentId":         "", // Environment ID of environment with the CopilotStudio App.
  "BotIdentifier":         "", // Schema Name of the Copilot to use
  "TenantId":              "", // Tenant ID of the App Registration used to login,  this should be in the same tenant as the Copilot.
  "AppClientId":           "", // App ID of the App Registration used to login,  this should be in the same tenant as the Copilot.
  "AzureOpenAiEndpoint":   "", // Azure OpenAI Endpoint
  "AzureOpenAiKey":        "", // Azure OpenAI Key
  "AzureOpenAiDeployment": ""  // Azure OpenAI Deployment
}
```

3. Edit the file `./Data/Evaluation Dataset.csv` and add the questions, ground truths and source links that you want to evaluate.

4. Build and run the EvalClient.exe program.

This should challenge you for login and connect ot the Copilot Studio Hosted bot. Then, it runs all the evaluations in the evaluation dataset and stores the results in the `.\bin\net9.0\Data\Evaluation Dataset Results.csv` file.

### Explanation

This RAG agent was created by adding a SharePoint knowledge source to the agent. The evaluator client asks the agent to answer the question provided in the "Test Utterance" 
field and compares the answer with the "Expected Response" answer. Based on how well the agent's answer matches the expected response semantically, a score is given 
between 0 and 100, 10 being the worst and 100 the perfect answer. The value is stored in the "Answer Score" field. The "Sources" field provided 2 URLs the agent should have used to answer the question. 
The evaluator client checks if the agent used the provided URLs to answer the question by returning them as reference links and returns it as x/y where x are the number of links provided by the agent 
over y which represents the number of links expected.

## Authentication

The EvalClient requires a User Token to operate. For this sample, we are using a user interactive flow to get the user token for the application ID created above.

The Copilot client will use a named `HttpClient` retrieved from the `IHttpClientFactory` as `mcs` injected in DI. This client needs to be configured with a `DelegatingHandler` to apply a valid Entra ID Token. In this sample using MSAL.
