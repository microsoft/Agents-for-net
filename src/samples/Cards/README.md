# Cards Sample

This Agent demonstrates the use of cards in an AgentApplication:

- AdaptiveCards
  - Action.Submit (Teams and WebChat)
  - Action.Execute (Teams only)
  - Data.Query/Search (Teams only)
- Activity Protocol -- Cards ([Channel dependent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-channels-reference?view=azure-bot-service-4.0#card-action-support-by-channel))
  - HeroCard
  - ThumbnailCard
  - AudioCard
  - VideoCard
  - AnimationCard
  - ReceiptCard

## Prerequisites

- [.Net](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) version 8.0
- [dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows)

## QuickStart using WebChat or Teams

- Overview of running and testing an Agent
  - Provision an Azure Bot in your Azure Subscription
  - Configure your Agent settings to use to desired authentication type
  - Running an instance of the Agent app (either locally or deployed to Azure)
  - Test in a client

1. Create an Azure Bot with one of these authentication types
   - [SingleTenant, Client Secret](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/agents-sdk/azure-bot-create-single-secret)
   - [SingleTenant, Federated Credentials](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/agents-sdk/azure-bot-create-federated-credentials) 
   - [User Assigned Managed Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/agents-sdk/azure-bot-create-managed-identity)
    
   > Be sure to follow the **Next Steps** at the end of these docs to configure your agent settings.

   > **IMPORTANT:** If you want to run your agent locally via devtunnels, the only support auth type is ClientSecrets and Certificates

1. Running the Agent
   1. Running the Agent locally
      - Requires a tunneling tool to allow for local development and debugging should you wish to do local development whilst connected to a external client such as Microsoft Teams.
      - **For ClientSecret or Certificate authentication types only.**  Federated Credentials and Managed Identity will not work via a tunnel to a local agent and must be deployed to an App Service or container.
      
      1. Run `dev tunnels`. Please follow [Create and host a dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) and host the tunnel with anonymous user access command as shown below:

         ```bash
         devtunnel host -p 3978 --allow-anonymous
         ```

      1. On the Azure Bot, select **Settings**, then **Configuration**, and update the **Messaging endpoint** to `{tunnel-url}/api/messages`

      1. Start the Agent in Visual Studio

   1. Deploy Agent code to Azure
      1. VS Publish works well for this.  But any tools used to deploy a web application will also work.
      1. On the Azure Bot, select **Settings**, then **Configuration**, and update the **Messaging endpoint** to `https://{{appServiceDomain}}/api/messages`

## Testing this agent with WebChat

   1. Select **Test in WebChat** on the Azure Bot

## Testing this Agent in Teams or M365

1. Update the manifest.json
   - Edit the `manifest.json` contained in the `/appManifest` folder
     - Replace with your AppId (that was created above) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `<<AAD_APP_CLIENT_ID>>`
     - Replace `<<BOT_DOMAIN>>` with your Agent url.  For example, the tunnel host name.
   - Zip up the contents of the `/appManifest` folder to create a `manifest.zip`
     - `manifest.json`
     - `outline.png`
     - `color.png`

1. Your Azure Bot should have the **Microsoft Teams** channel added under **Channels**.

1. Navigate to the Microsoft Admin Portal (MAC). Under **Settings** and **Integrated Apps,** select **Upload Custom App**.

1. Select the `manifest.zip` created in the previous step. 

1. After a short period of time, the agent shows up in Microsoft Teams and Microsoft 365 Copilot.

## Enabling JWT token validation
1. By default, the AspNet token validation is disabled in order to support local debugging.
1. Enable by updating appsettings
   ```json
   "TokenValidation": {
     "Enabled": true,
     "Audiences": [
       "{{ClientId}}" // this is the Client ID used for the Azure Bot
     ],
     "TenantId": "{{TenantId}}"
   },
   ```
