# Microsoft 365 Agents SDK - C# /.NET

The Microsoft 365 Agent SDK simplifies building full stack, multichannel, trusted agents for platforms including M365, Teams, Copilot Studio, and Webchat. We also offer integrations with 3rd parties such as Facebook Messenger, Slack, or Twilio. The SDK provides developers with the building blocks to create agents that handle user interactions, orchestrate requests, reason responses, and collaborate with other agents.

The M365 Agent SDK is a comprehensive framework for building enterprise-grade agents, enabling developers to integrate components from the Azure AI Foundry SDK, Semantic Kernel, as well as AI components from other vendors.

## Current Project State is PUBLIC PREVIEW

We are in preview with this codebase right now.

**This code base is a frequently updated replica of the master codebase**

**PREVIEW means:**

- **Do not use this code in a production environment or for production purposes.**
- Things are not yet stable and while we try hard to not break things, **we will break them** from time to time as we evolve this code base. Please be as  patient with us as possible.
- We are still revising things in this code base and reorganizing it.
- We may Add or Remove Features and capabilities from this code base during Preview.

## Using this code

### Public Nuget feed.
The best way to consume this SDK is via our Nuget packages found here: [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/nugetbotbuilder). They will all begin with **Microsoft.Agents**

### Nightly Nuget feed.
**Updated March 11 2025** :  Nightly Feed has been shifted to public [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/nugetbotbuilder). They will all begin with **Microsoft.Agents**  and have a version number that ends with **-alpha.**
- This feed is updated overnight (PT) whenever commits occur in our repo. 
- This feed's packages will be much more up to date with the current repo, however, packages provided on this feed are not necessary stable.
